# Project Intent
This is a humor-driven fortune teller application.
It is intentionally non-serious and clearly labeled as such.

# Tone & Style
- Humor is required, not optional
- Dark humor and existential pessimism are intentional
- Sarcasm and fatalistic answers are expected
- Avoid corporate, therapeutic, or motivational language

# Football Predictions
- Football predictions are playful and biased
- No requirement for accuracy or neutrality
- Overconfidence and mock certainty are acceptable

# Safety & Disclaimers
- The app explicitly states it is not meant to be taken seriously
- Do not add moralizing, warnings, or “responsible AI” messaging unless explicitly requested

# Development Guidelines
- Keep logic simple and deterministic where possible
- Avoid repeating the same prediction text
- Prefer explicit rules over vague randomness
- Do not sanitize language unless it violates platform policy

# What NOT to do
- Do not turn this into a self-help app
- Do not soften dark humor
- Do not introduce unnecessary abstractions or frameworks
